# README -- Repository Directory

This "repo" is really just a Catalog of my other Repositories.

## infrastructure

Leftover Crap from one of my jobs.
I keep it around in case I want to see how something was done.
I probably should delete it ... as I never really look.

## music

I had the Bright Idea to keep my CD Catalog online. You see,
it's Hieratchical, and I can point people to it. Just Beginning...

## rbj-svn

This is an older copy of the one listed below. You see, it used to be
a Subversion repo. I'll probably delete this soon.

## ._

Yes, you read that right: Dot Underscore.

This is my Environment, all the stuff I care about.
Ir contains my Dotfiles, bin/, emacs/
(which is outdated because I am using vim these days),
src/, doc/, misc/, and various subdirs for scripts and
config I used at various jobs, such as nih/ and ddn/.

I should probably split the this one up, but it's not that big.
